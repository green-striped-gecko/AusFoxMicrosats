## Abstract
Reconstructing biological invasions from historical sources can provide insights into how they occur but are difficult to do when invasions are poorly documented. Genetic signatures left by invaders can also offer insights into invasion routes, points of origin, and general biology but often present conclusions that are contradictory to expectations. Here, we test the ability of continental-wide microsatellite genotype data from 29 loci and 3122 samples to reconstruct the well-documented invasion of red foxes Vulpes vulpes from the United Kingdom into Australia over 150 years ago, an invasion that has led to the extinction of many native species. Our analysis reveals several key signals of invasion evident in Australian foxes. They display lower levels of diversity than foxes sampled from the UK, exhibit clines in diversity from the point of introduction (south-east Australia) to the edge of their range, and show strong evidence of allele surfing in westerly and north-easterly directions. These characteristics are consistent with a single point of origin followed by rapid expansion in westerly and north-easterly directions as suggested by historical records. We also find little genetic structure in foxes across Australia with only the vast Nullarbor Plains and Great Victoria Desert region presenting a detectable barrier to their dispersal. As such, no mainland region within the current range of foxes can be considered genetically isolated and therefore appropriate for localised eradication efforts. Overall, our analyses demonstrate the ability of comprehensive population genetic studies to reconstruct invasion histories even after more than 80 years since colonisation.
